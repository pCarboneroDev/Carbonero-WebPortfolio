# Personal Web Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, a space where I showcase my projects, experience, and skills as a developer.

# ⚠IMPORTANT⚠
The portfolio is currently in active development. At the moment, the content is static, but I am working on making it fully dynamic through a custom Python API that will allow real-time updates and more scalable content management.

# Features
- Fully designed and developed by me
-  Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap 5
-  Organized sections for projects, skills, contact, etc
-  Continuous improvements and new functionality planned
-  Will soon integrate a backend API for dynamic content
